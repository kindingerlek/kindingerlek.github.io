Captured during a somber winter afternoon in Curitiba, this series explores the architectural geometry and urban textures of Brazil's ecological capital. The monochromatic treatment emphasizes the interplay between the city's modernist structures and the dramatic cloud formations that frequently blanket the Paraná sky.

What began as a casual walk through downtown evolved into a meditation on how weather shapes the mood of urban environments. The absence of color draws attention to form, shadow, and the subtle gradations of light that define the cityscape.

The iconic Oscar Niemeyer Museum, with its bold curves, provides a striking contrast to the linear office buildings that dominate the financial district. Through these images, I aimed to document not just the physical character of Curitiba, but the contemplative atmosphere that emerges when the vibrant city is stripped of its color palette.
