This portrait study of Gandalf the Grey was created using various grades of graphite pencils on heavy-weight drawing paper. The piece focuses on capturing the essence of this iconic character through careful attention to value and texture, particularly in the details of his weathered face, flowing beard, and the worn fabric of his signature grey robes.

I wanted to portray the moment of quiet contemplation, a brief respite between his many adventures. Through careful layering and blending of graphite, I worked to achieve the depth in his contemplative expression and the subtle play of light across the different textures.

The drawing was completed using a combination of H and B grade pencils, allowing for both precise detail work and rich dark values, with special attention paid to preserving the paper's highlights for the most luminous areas.
