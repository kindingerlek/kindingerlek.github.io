## Urban Pulse

I led the development of "Urban Pulse," a civic engagement platform that bridges the gap between citizens and their local government services.

### The Challenge

Citizens struggled to access municipal services efficiently, while local governments lacked meaningful data on community needs and service utilization patterns.

### My Solution

Working with city officials and community organizers, I designed and implemented:

- **Service Discovery Hub**: Created an intuitive interface for residents to find, filter, and access over 200 municipal services based on location and need
- **Issue Reporting System**: Developed a geospatial reporting tool that allows citizens to document infrastructure issues with 97% accuracy in location tracking
- **Community Dashboard**: Built interactive data visualizations that help officials identify service gaps and optimize resource allocation
- **Engagement Tools**: Implemented real-time notification systems and feedback loops that increased citizen participation in public forums by 64%

### Technical Highlights

- Engineered a progressive web app that works seamlessly across devices with offline capabilities
- Implemented secure authentication with role-based access for citizens, officials, and administrators
- Created a scalable backend using Node.js and PostgreSQL that handles 50,000+ daily interactions
- Designed an accessible UI that meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards for universal access

### Impact & Results

Urban Pulse has been adopted by 5 municipalities serving over 350,000 citizens. The platform has reduced service response times by 47% and increased citizen satisfaction ratings from 61% to 89%. Municipal departments report saving approximately 1,200 staff hours monthly through streamlined processes.

The project won the National Civic Innovation Award and has been featured as a case study in "Government Technology" magazine.

**Technologies Used**: React, Redux, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Mapbox, D3.js, PWA, Jest, Docker, CircleCI, AWS
